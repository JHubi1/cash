## Exchange Rates

This package has baked-in exchange rates for all currencies. These were last fetched on **2025-08-11**. The exchange rates are updated automatically when the package is updated.

If you need more up-to-date exchange rate data, you can use this static method of the `Currency` class:

```dart
Currency.refetchExchangeRates();
```

It will fetch the latest exchange rates from [fawazahmed0/exchange-api](https://github.com/fawazahmed0/exchange-api) and update the exchange rate of all currencies in the package. Note that this will not persist the data, so you will need to call this method every time you want to update the exchange rates.

You should override the `userAgent` argument of the `refetchExchangeRates` method to a unique value, such as your app name or package name, to avoid being rate-limited by the API.

You can also use `Currency.overwriteExchangeRate(double rate)` to overwrite the exchange rate of a specific currency manually:

```dart
Currency.eur.overwriteExchangeRate(1.2); // Means: 1 EUR = 1.2 USD
```
